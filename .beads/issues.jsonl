In addition to the Open Library, Project Gutenberg should be listed as an option now.\n- [ ] Search Project Gutenberg using an instance of Gutendex. The constants.yml (example in constants.yml.example file) file should now contain variables pointing to the Gutendex public API URL.\n- [ ] When a Project Gutenberg text is selected, create a ToC for it with status 'empty'. Support multi-selecting titles to make ToCs for, as with Open Library. Record the full-te\n- [ ] When viewing a Toc based on a Project Gutenberg text, instead of browsing scans, offer to browse the fulltext content (defaulting to HTML, falling back to plaintext). The URLs are in the 'formats' key in the Book JSON returned by the Gutendex API. The fulltext view should open to the right of the TOC transcription textarea, and have limited height, with a vertical scrollbar.\n- [ ] Mock the Gutendex API for tests\n\n## Background\n\n- the Gutendex API is described here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garethbjohnson/gutendex/refs/heads/master/readme.md\n\n## Scope\n\n**Out of Scope:**\n- setting up the Gutendex API server\n","design":"## Architecture\n\n[Describe the overall architecture and approach]\n\n## Components\n\n- Component 1: [description]\n- Component 2: [description]\n\n## Dependencies\n\n[List external dependencies or constraints]\n","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] All child issues are completed\n- [ ] Integration tests pass\n- [ ] Documentation is updated\n- [ ] Code review completed\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-11-27T06:23:52.146671989+02:00","updated_at":"2025-11-27T15:41:33.476811604+02:00","closed_at":"2025-11-27T15:41:33.476811604+02:00","labels":["epic"]}

{"id":"tocoe-qpus","title":"Design and implement a people-matcher UI element","description":"In several contexts we would need to associate an object (a Toc, a Work, an Expression) with a Person. This is often complex due to our input being strings (sometimes even not full names but initials) and our aim being to link to specific well-identified entities in external authority databses (VIAF, Wikidata, Library of Congress).\n\nWe need a UI component to perform such associations. I am not sure of the most appropriate UX -- a modal dialog? a collapsible? -- and would like you to consider and decide what would work best, based on the requirements.\n\nGiven a name string (mandatory) and optionally a set of one or more candidate identifications (in the form of [source,ID,name string], e.g. ['wikidata', 'Q42', 'Douglas Adams']), search our own database of Persons as well as all defined authority sources (VIAF, Wikidata, Library of Congress) for the given name string, and show the user the results in four parallel scrollable lists (one per source). Any candidate identifications given in advance (those would be drawn from the context of the containing publication or input by the user outside this UI element) should be placed at the TOP of the results from the specified source, with some emphasis or a \"likely in context\" badge, to help the user consider those potential matches first. Provide basic information about each return search result -- at the very least, life years and country, if known. Also, mark any result from an external source that is linked to one of our existing Person records with a badge like 'in DB', to signal to the user that this is a person already linked to some works or Tocs in our database.\n\nEach potential match presented to the user should have a collapsible triggered by a button; if the user clicks the button, more context should be loaded from the relevant source about the person, to assist the user in determining whether that's the right match. The precise context should match what's available in the source, and loaded via AJAX on demand (not in advance).\n\nEach result should also have a 'Match!' button. Once a user clicks that button, associate the object the UI element was launched with (Toc, Work, Expression) with the selected Person. If the match chosen is from one of the external sources that don't have a Person linked yet, create a new Person record and populate it with as much authority data as possible: for instance, if a Wikidata item was selected, create a Person recording that Wikidata QID, but also look up that Wikidata item and check whether it has a P244 property linking to the Library of Congress, and record that if it does, and likewise whether it has a VIAF ID (P214). Likewise when creating a person from VIAF or LoC.\n\nThis is complex, so after reading all this, first come up with a UX/UI design for such a component, mock it up, and show me one or several possibilities (with mock data), and name the one you would most recommend. After I give input, you can proceed to implement. Consider breaking implementation down into several beads.\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-14T07:13:21.781633147+02:00","updated_at":"2025-12-14T14:35:48.264269223+02:00","closed_at":"2025-12-14T14:35:48.264269223+02:00"}

(In imports from Open Library, the Open Library identifier is also stored.)\n\nWe want to enable users to map those strings to specific authority records in one of several sources: VIAF.org, Wikidata, or the Library of Congress Authority records.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Users can initiate a query and (manual) selection view for EACH author name (some works will have more than one). Upon selecting a match, it will get recorded ALONGSIDE the existing string. Also record a *ROLE* for the person (by default: 'author', but we expect many 'translator' roles as well, at the very least) in the context of the specific publication or individual work. The association of this external ID should be made to the Person record, but the role should be recorded in a link table between the Publication/Work and the Person.\n- [ ] Existing associations can be corrected (by deleting and associating anew)\n- [ ] Also record Project Gutenberg author IDs (e.g. https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/4527 for Ernest Renan) on importing from Project Gutenberg\n\n","design":"## Architecture\n\n[Describe the overall architecture and approach]\n\n## Components\n\n- Component 1: [description]\n- Component 2: [description]\n\n## Dependencies\n\n[List external dependencies or constraints]\n","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] All child issues are completed\n- [ ] Integration tests pass\n- [ ] Documentation is updated\n- [ ] Code review completed\n","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-13T00:36:46.430848205+02:00","updated_at":"2025-12-13T01:23:42.661059575+02:00","labels":["epic"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"tocoe-yfj","depends_on_id":"tocoe-7bz","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-13T01:26:11.071902889+02:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"tocoe-yfj","depends_on_id":"tocoe-85o","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-13T01:26:11.089062104+02:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"tocoe-yfj","depends_on_id":"tocoe-wd9","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-13T01:26:11.103685396+02:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"tocoe-yfj","depends_on_id":"tocoe-toc","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-13T01:26:11.116414623+02:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"tocoe-yfj","depends_on_id":"tocoe-a9u","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-13T01:26:11.12935656+02:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"tocoe-yfj","depends_on_id":"tocoe-4vz","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-13T01:26:11.152510294+02:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"tocoe-yfj","depends_on_id":"tocoe-sn0","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-13T01:26:11.167742574+02:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

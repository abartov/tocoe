Notes from FRBR Aggregates WG report:

page 5:
- aggregate works, aggregating other works, e.g. being the "work" created by an anthology editor.
- one aggregate manifestation embodies multiple expressions, but also embodies the aggreate expression of the aggregate work
page 6:
- augmentations are dependent works added to an independent work (forewords, introductions, etc.)

Probably not needed:
- Subject entity (well, more probably a shell of an entity -- a collection of potential foreign keys -- LCSH id, Wikidata Q number, ...)

Design notes
============

*Works with multiple chapters are not the scope of this project at the moment.  Rather, it deals with assorted collections of separate works.
*Assorted Collections (e.g. anthologies, essay collections, journals) will be modeled as follows:
**each article, essay, story, etc., is modeled with a Work and an Expression, completely independent of the Manifestation.
**each such Work and Expression are additionally _components_ of an automatically-generated Work and Expression for the _collection_.  That aggregating Work and Expression are largely uninteresting.
**each such Expression is _embodied_ by _the same_ Manifestation -- one Manifestation per collection
**the _sequence_ of the works in the collection is expressed with the _sequence_number_ attribute of the Embodiment entity used to make the relationship between the Expression and the Manifestation.  It is thus possible to recreate the collections sequences "table of contents" by gathering all embodiments and sorting them by ascending sequence_number
***This is as _distinct_ from the sequence of component works within a work -- e.g. a sonnet sequence -- where the aggregation and sequence are part of the actual work, rather than of some later curatorial act by an anthologist or publisher.
**the aggregating Expression only knows the individual expressions are its components, but doesn't know their sequence.
**the aggregating Expression is embodied in the Manifestation as well, but with a nil (or zero?) sequence_number, so it's to be excluded from reconstructed tables of contents.

ToC Markdown
============

Metadata fields: TBD

1. top-level work or work-group (i.e. article in anthology, short story in collection, poem in poetry book) are denoted by lines starting with #
Example:
# On Dreaming

2. title pages are ignored.  (TODO: maybe denote with markdown but not create entities for?)

3. front matter is to be treated as follows: items called "Acknowledgments", "Preface", "Foreword", "From the Author", "Dedication" etc. are ignored and not cataloged at all.  Items titled "Introduction" or "Introduction: <some descriptive name>" (i.e. essentially an introductory essay, and not a mere preface) are to be cataloged like all other works.  Likewise, afterwords are to be ignored when less than a full essay.

4. work that is a component of other work is denoted by lines starting with ## (or ### if further nested)
Example:
# Ducks in Winter
## Ducks of Glory
## Ducks of Misery
## Ducks of Navarone

5. section/part names are listed as lines starting with # but ending with a slash (/)  The slash serves as a signifier of not being a work, but merely an organizing title.  No entities would be created for it.  For example:
# Part I: 17th Century Sculpture /

6. An individual work's author(s) are specified after the work title and the combination '||'. Multiple authors are to be separated by semicolons.
Example 1: Hamlet || William Shakespeare
Example 2: Metaphors We Live By || George Lakoff; Mark Johnson

7. If no individual author is specified, the book's principal author(s) are linked with each work and expression

8. TBD: translators (expressions) vs. original authors (works)

Integrated examples:
====================

1. For a Table of Content (by a single author) that looks like this:

Acknowledgments
Preface
Introduction: The Artist as Thinker
Part 1: Monet
Monet and His Contemporaries
The Salon of 1897:
  1. The Submissions
  2. The Exhibition
  3. The Aftermath
Impressionism or Bad Art?
Part 2: Revolution
Rivals and Reviewers
Taking a Stand
Afterword

The markdown would look like this:

TODO: Metadata TBD

#Introduction: The Artist as Thinker
#Part 1: Monet /
#Monet and His Contemporaries
#The Salon of 1897
##The Submissions
##The Exhibition
##The Aftermath
#Impressionism or Bad Art?
#Part 2: Revolution /
#Rivals and Reviewers
#Taking a Stand

2. For a ToC of an anthology that looks like this:

Preface
Introduction: Modern Approaches To Plato.......Stephen J. Someone
Plato, Founder of Totalitarianism..............Deborah K. Someone
Rhetoric in Plato's Political Thought..........Susan L. Someone
Plato's Good Questions and Bad Answers.........E. R. Someone and Joy Someone
Poets as Dissidents............................Jason R. Someone
Conclusion: Plato's Relevance Today............Stephen J. Someone

The markdown would look like this:

#Introduction: Modern Approaches To Plato || Stephen J. Someone
#Plato, Founder of Totalitarianism || Deborah K. Someone
#Rhetoric in Plato's Political Thought || Susan L. Someone
#Plato's Good Questions and Bad Answers || E. R. Someone; Joy Someone
#Poets as Dissidents || Jason R. Someone
#Conclusion: Plato's Relevance Today || Stephen J. Someone

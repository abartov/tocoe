# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      faq:
        title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
        q1_question: "What license are my contributions released under?"
        q1_answer: "All contributions to ToCoE are released under CC0 (Creative Commons Zero), which dedicates them to the public domain. This means anyone can use, modify, and distribute the data freely without restrictions."
        q2_question: "Can I edit a TOC after it's been verified?"
        q2_answer: "Yes, verified TOCs can still be edited if errors are discovered. However, they may need to be verified again after significant changes."
        q3_question: "Why can't I create a TOC for this book?"
        q3_answer: "You can only create TOCs for books with publicly available full text. Books marked as 'Restricted' or 'Metadata Only' cannot have TOCs created because we need access to the actual content."
        q4_question: "What if a book doesn't have a table of contents?"
        q4_answer: "When browsing scans, check the 'No explicit table of contents' box. You can still create a basic TOC by listing the main sections or chapters you identify in the book."
        q5_question: "How do I handle books with unusual formats?"
        q5_answer: "Use the markdown format's flexibility: use section headings (/) for organizational purposes, nest chapters under main works (##), and include authors when known. If you're unsure, look at similar verified TOCs for examples."
        q6_question: "Can I verify multiple TOCs at once?"
        q6_answer: "No, each TOC must be verified individually to ensure thorough review. Quality is more important than quantity!"
        q7_question: "What happens if OCR gives poor results?"
        q7_answer: "If OCR output is too messy to clean up easily, you can always transcribe manually instead. Sometimes manual transcription is faster than fixing bad OCR!"
